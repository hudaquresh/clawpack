"""
Script to run a code or restart it from a checkpoint file automatically.

Needs to be cleaned up and made more general.

Assumes code is compiled already.

    python run_with_restart.py

Will do the following:

 - Check whether _output exists with data from a run that appeared to
   complete (by checking last line of fort.amr -- more robust way?).

 - If so, it quits,

 - If _output exists with at least one checkpoint file, it will use the 
   more recent one to restart the code.

 - If _output does not exist, it runs the code from scratch.

So you should be able to type the command above, hit Ctrl-C, and repeat this
process an arbitrary number of times and eventually the full output will be
generated.  

Notes:

 - This requires replacing `check.f` by `check_twofiles.f` in the Makefile
   to use the version that alternates writing two sets of checkpoint files
   rather than accumulating files.

 - The setrun.py file is used also for the restart.  The clawdata.restart
   value is set to True and written to claw.data explicitly from this script.

 - check_twofiles.f also flushes buffers for output to fort.gauge,
   fort.amr, fort.debug so output is not lost.

 - Before restarting, it moves any fort.gauge file to fort.gauge_<datetime>
   so that eventually these can be catenated together (after editing out
   repeated entries).
